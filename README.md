### **Dataset source**

Link to dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/nitishsharma01/olympics-124-years-datasettill-2020?select=Athletes_summer_games.csv

## **Objective**
To determine the top achieving countries, in the Winter and Summer Olympics, over a fourty year period between 1980 - 2020. 

Please note: Countries in my dataset/visuals are referred to as "Areas", due to the inclusion of combined regions e.g. USSR. The term "Areas" also serves an inclusive term for participating islands and teams such as: IOC Refugee Olympic Team.

## **Justification**

By tracking the performance of the top countries in the Olympics, other nations can use the data as a benchmark for their own performance. It helps countries set realistic goals and targets for their athletes and national sports programs. By studying the successes and failures of leading nations, aspiring countries can identify areas for improvement and develop strategies to enhance their own sporting achievements.
